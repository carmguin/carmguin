Dear GitHub hiring manager,

Throughout my career, I have always been eager to learn more and aspired to grow into new positions and roles. I am currently working in the niche Fine Arts services and storage market. I came to Crozier Fine Arts as a receptionist and strived to position myself as a candidate for opportunities that opened within the company. In doing so, I climbed from a receptionist to two roles in operations and then to client services. 

I am highly motivated to succeed at a technology-centric company, and I hope to start that journey as a Customer Success Manager at GitHub. I will contribute my customer-focused experience to the position by
- growing accounts by demonstrating the value of GetHub's projects to decision-makers 
- proactively engage clients to identify challenges and strategize solutions
- advocating for clients with internal stakeholders across various departments

It would be great to speak with you to discuss this position and what I can offer. 

Sincerely,<br>
Carmen
